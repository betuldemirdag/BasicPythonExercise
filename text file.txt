Diana is at the airport. She waits for her flight. Her flight is to Amsterdam, and it is 4 hours away. Diana walks around the airport and looks at the shops. She has a nice time.
After an hour she wants to visit the bathroom. She searches for it, but she doesn’t find it.
“Where is the bathroom?” she asks herself.
She looks and looks but can’t find it, then she starts asking people where it is and asks, “Sir, sorry but do you know the directions for the lady’s bathroom?”
Man: “You mean the restroom, right?”
Diana: “No, I mean the bathroom.”
Man: “Well, the restroom is over there.” He says and walks away.
Diana doesn’t understand. She asks a lady: “Excuse me madam, could you please tell me where is the bathroom?”
“The restroom is over there,” the lady answers and walks away.
Diana is confused. “What’s their problem? I need to use the bathroom and they send me to rest?! I don’t need a restroom, I need the bathroom!”
After a while Diana gives up. She feels tired after all these walking and asking, decides that the man and the woman might be right and that she needs to rest.
She walks to the restroom. Now she is surprised. She realizes the restroom is actually the name for a public bathroom!
